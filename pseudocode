get and open file from the command line, be sure to do error checking

while(true)
{
    read in the line, store in string
 
    if (line == "*****")
    {
        break;
    }
    else
    {
        split the string into the numerical code and the character
 
        check to see if the character (string label) is a special character, if it is, assign correct characters
        
        add the characters into a map
    }
}

read in the line with the number of bits

read in the characters to decode from the file as a string























convert the codes into characters

for (int i = 0; i < charToDecode.length(); i++)
{
    turn the character into 8 bits

    go through each of the bits for that character
    
    for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++)
    {
        if (we aren't over the number of bits given at the beginning)
        {
            increase the counter

            add one bit to the working string and check if it matches any of the character codes

            check to see if the working string matches one of the codes
                - if it does, add the character to the output string and clear the working string
        }
    }
